                    <b>Community distribution of naloxone is effective:</b>
                    <br>
                    Injection Drug Users in Chicago reported having witnessed a median of six overdoses in their lifetime, while medical personnel were called in only 30% described overdoses. Bystander intervention is thus key to reducing overdoses. One analysis of a naloxone distribution program in Massachusetts found that overdose death rates were 27 to 46 percent lower in communities implementing opioid education and naloxone distribution programs. A systematic review of observational studies found that community distribution of naloxone kits was consistently associated with decreased mortality from opioid overdose.

                    <b>Our project:</b>
                    <br>
                    We are distributing overdose prevention boxes containing naloxone in surrounding communities. We have placed a few boxes around the city in indoor areas and will be rolling out several more in the Spring and Summer, when temperatures allow Naloxone to be kept outside.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These boxes keep Naloxone out of light and contain information for how to administer Naloxone, how to spot signs of an overdose, and will have information on local mental health, addiction, and harm reduction resources. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Contact us at info@uchrp.org if you are willing to host a box.
